It's good to remember that Al Capone's business card said he was a **used** furniture dealer. I'm just putting that out there.

The Tea Party had it's annual "why do we need to pay taxes" whine-along yesterday, and I was glad to see that there were only about 38 people who showed up in Mission Viejo. Nationwide attendance was way down. Maybe folks are starting to catch onto the fact that the problem isn't that we pay taxes; the problem is the inequality caused by someone like Mitt Romney only paying 15% when the average working stiff pays over 20% according to the C.B.O. Maybe these tea party types have finally figured out they were nothing more than stooges for the Koch Brothers...or maybe not...after all, there were people who thought Al Capone actually dealt in used furniture.

PEW Research released a study the other day; twenty percent of American's are not online.  The figures are startling to anyone who hasn't been watching the decline of the United States in the world. Among those not online are 60% of senior citizens, people who make less than $30,000 a year, and high school dropouts.  In other words, it's a pretty safe bet that the majority of the 38 people who protested taxes on Monday in Mission Viejo aren't online. 

The official Tea Party page for Mission Viejo, which is at the official Tea Party site, has 3 members.  One of them lives in Alabama. One lives in Dana Point. And only the head of the Mission Viejo Tea Party actually lives in Mission Viejo.

At first I thought that the people who belong to the Tea Party in Mission Viejo, like Cathy Schlicht and Larry Gilbert, just weren't proud of their allegiance and didn't want to wear it like a S.D.S. arm band. They sure talk tough as Capone...so I started thinking that the problem  must not be a lack of pride. They must belong to the 20 percent of the backward who are not online.  They, in other words, live on the wrong side of the digital tracks.  

Makes me wonder why Todd Spitzer shows up every year to address the dwindling crowd.  I only know three things about Todd Spitzer.  

1. He recently asked someone of Larry Gilbert was the "godfather" of Mission Viejo. I can only hope he was being tongue-in-cheek.
2. He took more freebies up in Sacramento than anyone else.  Seems Todd is a fan of classic rock and availed himself to all the free concert tickets lobbyist wanted to hand him.  And I can't blame him for that. If I had been elected to the California Assembly, I would have been in front of Todd in that line every single time. 
3. He is endorsed by the California Republican Assembly who also endorses Cathy Schlicht and Rhonda Reardon.  Not the best recommendation in the world. Schlicht and Reardon are both card-carrying, intellectually-challenged zealots. 

Someone with the Spitzer campaign went public in the comment section of the Mission Viejo Patch and called Spitzer's current opponent a "drunk." It was such a tactless, vindictive attempt to slam an opponent, I'm going to let you read it in its entirety.

Todd Spitzer Campaign

Todd Spitzer Campaign: it is typical for Deb Pauly and her supporters to insult everyone who is trying to make America better if Pauly isn't the self-annointed leader. Pauly's entire elected City Council of Villa Park supports Spitzer. <strong>Pauly has cost her small city in the tens of thousands for extra Sheriff's security because of her vile and racist remarks.</strong> (emphasis added) She and her husband were drunk in the City of Orange on February 5, 2011 when she tried to distract the police during their drunk driving investigation of her husband. Her husband slipped his hand-cuffs while in the back of the police car after he was arrested. Pauly then demanded that she be given the keys to the car to drive it home. The officer refused the drunken Pauly from being the menace that she is and driving drunk too. Pauly is vile, reckless and a hypocrite. Spitzer is supported by Sheriff Hutchens, Supervisors Bates, Campbell and Nguyen. Check out his endorsements at www.toddspitzer.com . Pauly has no support. Period. Her statements on this site demeaning the good people who attended the rally to show their love for our Country should be condemned just like everything else that Pauly and her cronies are involved with. Pauly ruins everything and everyone that she touches or is involved with. Her evil will continue to be exposed in this campaign. Pauly cannot be allowed to hold any office in this county.

What I find **disturbing** is the attention given to the **"fact"** that Pauly is a drunk, and **the fact that Pauly is apparently a racist is a throw away line**. Are *those* really the priorities of the Republican Party? I mean they are certainly in line with what I know of Schlicht and Reardon. 

What lead up to the blast from Spitzer's campaign was a bunch of sniping comments about the nature of the Mission Viejo Tea Partiers by a rival fraction of the Tea Party.  It wasn't pretty and it made me glad that the internet wasn't around in my S.D.S. days so that the infighting didn't happen in public. That is never pretty.  And the public display is about as classy as rubbing out a bunch of guys in a south-side garage on Valentine's day.
