I'd better write this before Father Frank gives me any more shit about being soft on the Tea Party and Evangelists. I just don't need that level of moral harassment right now; now when the Democrat in the White House is actually assassinating American Citizens.

It's election season here in Mission Viejo.  Fear and loathing will get you halfway there. This is a strange town because of a small, vocal, minority.  It's a lot like, well, actually The United States without the threat of a Guilded Age resurgence.  No Larry Gilbert and his queer friends would have everyone reduced to a depression era breadline.  

One of Larry's queer friends is Desi "Dizzy" Kiss who is and isn't running for a seat on the Mission Viejo City Council. Old Dizzy did "pull papers," but he didn't want to pay for a ballot statement. Given that we all know he is just in this race as a desperate move to give Cathy Schlicht some cover. He'll spew Larry's lies and garbage and never really be a serious candidate.

So far Dizzy has found two serious (eye roll) problems here in Mission Viejo:

### Problem One

There wasn't a flag in the city clerk's office when she asked Dizzy to take the Oath of Allegiance. And while the city clerk did offer to take Dizzy into the Council Chambers where there was a flag, he said "it wasn't necessary." Two days later he's asking one of the two sitting council members what sort of city he is running. I find that odd.  Why just ask one of them?  Especially when the one he didn't ask is the moronic Schlicht. 

### Problem Two

The city gives business cards to contract employees.  Seriously? That's a problem? Does this Dizzy Kiss realize we have gay teenagers here in Mission Viejo who contemplate suicide?  Does he care? 

Look, I don't mind if those clowns over in Mortonville want to run a spoiler.  Just let someone other than Larry Gilbert write his stuff. The arguments are amazingly stupid so far. Stunningly so. And they're quite boring to respond to.  I give it two weeks before they really toss him under the bus on Brad Morton's blog the Dis-Patch.
