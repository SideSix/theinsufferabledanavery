 > Following then-councilman Lance MacLean’s attempt to strangle a co-worker at UCI, a band of political types supported him in 2009. His supporters became known as “The Dark Side” for their bullying tactics and downright filthy language. MacLean’s foul-mouth bullies are back, promoting their new candidate for council, Wendy Bucknum. &ndash; Dale Tyler
 
Or so Dale Tyler claims on his blog. I'm assuming that I am "The Dark Side" because I was the only one who used "filthy language." At least as far as Dale knows. Others used it in private I'm sure, but I'm the only one who shot off his foul-mouth in public. So the use of the plural "bullies" is completely misleading, as I'm sure Mr. Tyler knows.

### Here Is What I Said

 > If there is, indeed, a hell, all we can know for sure is that Larry Gilbert will be kneeling on the other side of the Glory Hole. 
 
 Actually there isn't a "filthy" word in that statement, but the image is as foul as Tyler and his friends themselves.

I also called Connie Lee, or it may have been Gail Reavis, "a drunken slut."  I really can't remember which one it was; in my mind that phrase applies to both equally in a metaphorical sense, not a literal sense. But I bet **you** already knew that.

While the word "slut" can be considered "filthy," it can also be used as an odd sort of term of endearment. If, while having hot, sweaty sex, you have never called the other person a "slut," or if you've never been called a "slut" by the other person, well then...good people...you are just not having enough fun. 

### Deconstructing Dale Tyler

While I will vote for Ms. Bucknum, I am **not** promoting her.  She will be great for our community, because she truly cares about it and she **truly** understands the vast majority of the people who call Mission Viejo home. *But*, and I repeat, I am not out there promoting her in any way, shape, or form.  After all, I am "The Dark Side" and I wouldn't do a damn thing to harm Ms. Bucknum's chances of winning her election. 

So, from his comments, I can only assume that Dale Tyler believes the leadership of both Orange County and Mission Viejo are "foul-mouth bullies," because it is [they who have endorsed Ms. Bucknum](http://wendybucknum.com/2011/10/orange-county-mission-viejo-leaders-endorse-wendy-bucknums-bid-for-city-council/) and it is they who **are** promoting Ms. Bucknum.
