I started this blog about three years ago because I went to a Mission Viejo City Council meeting to see if the council was going to approve a dog park. I have a dog named Hunter and at the time he was about six months old. I came home from that one meeting knowing I'd have to get involved in city politics in some fashion.  The problem? Some right-wing fascists were trying to take over the Mission Viejo City Council.

Hunter is going on four years old now and the dog park still isn't built. Let's be clear about something. A dog park is a two **maybe** three meeting decision.  There are something like 22,000 dog owners in Mission Viejo and about 23 people who are opposed to the dog park. Any idiot can do the politics on that one. Or so you'd think...

The Mission Viejo Dog Park was placed on the agenda in 2002. It's now 2012. The city has 53% of it's budget in reserves, they have $8 million that has to be spent on parks. Conservatives don't appear to be the sharpest tools in the shed. But then they tend to descend from the Puritan stock which fled Europe because their way of thinking was mocked and scorned. And now those European countries are extremely progressive and could teach the United States a thousand things about Human Rights. 

Anyway, this blog gives me a place to vent.  I wouldn't take anything I say **too** seriously.  After all I could be wrong. I pretty much wing it on the shit I don't make up out of thin air. 

I usually clean up the language on pieces I like and publish that sanitized version on [The Mission Viejo Patch](http://missionviejopatch.com). 

My day job is creating stuff. You know poems, images, web sites, blog posts, and lots of other things. I try to see myself as a craftsman and I'm very interested in the newer web technologies &ndash; now that you don't have to put a poem inside of a table.  That was just a **little too violent**for my tastes. 

So these days I'm playing around with ruby and static site generators to speed up the work flow, but still produce quality. 

The other day I stumbled onto Octopress.  I'm checking it out.  So far I'm loving it. Below is the relevant parts of the Octopress README file. 

Have fun! Be nice to each other.
