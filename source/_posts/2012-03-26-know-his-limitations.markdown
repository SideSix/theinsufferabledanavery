Funny thing. When I first started to speak out in Mission Viejo about this group that was trying to recall someone 8 months before a scheduled election, people kept saying that I was "brave." Something didn't smell right to me. Conservatives don't waste money, so clearly they had a lot to gain by having a special recall election 8 months before the general.  Well, it turns out, in special elections only the really old vote and this group spends a lot of time in Costa Del Sol "helping" old people fill out their absentee ballots.  Get it?  Think about it and you will.

It's fairly easy to steal an election if you're in the person's living room filling out their ballots for, I mean with, them and there isn't an elelction official within five miles. Cheating at its finest and it turns out that is the only way Morton's Gang of Five can get thier agenda through official channels.  

"Okay", you say, "that's just some sleazy behaivor. Why'd they think you are brave?" Hell if I know, really. It's not like they can shave my head, put in me in a uniform, and march me onto a plane to Vietnam. The fuckers who **could** do that to me didn't scare me either. I stood up to them by joing the S.D.S. and protesting their immoral war. And I gotta say, Richard Nixon was a lot more scary and ruthless than Brad Morton or Larry Gilbert.

Other than this group has stalked people, and they publically bully people with words, I have no idea why they seem frightening to people, and why I'm credited with being brave.  Maybe it's their tendancy to bully people on blogs where it's safe.  

Take this recent dog park issue. Three people have gone onto the blogs to bully and name call: [Griggs Fam](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1473142504), [MVDadster](http://missionviejo.patch.com/users/mv-dadster), and [Zippy Dog](http://missionviejo.patch.com/users/zippy-dog). You can email Zippy Dog at zippy@gmail.com.

MVDadster and Zippy Dog actually created accounts at the Mission Viejo Patch just for this dog park issue; I've been waiting for Morton to order someone to do that and I'm surprised it's taken him this long.  

I'll be deconstructing MV Dadsters approach in an article soon, line by line. 

Zippy Dog is blantantly just there to name call.  You can see this person [in action here on this blog](http://theinsufferabledanavery.com/blog/2012/03/21/and-then-the-aliens-dot-dot-dot/). 

Zippy Dog is a punk, and probably is Gail Reavis, one of the people who stalked the former city manager, costing this city over $600,000 in a legal judgment, who cost the city another $750,000 in a legal judgment, who tried to sue the city for $10,020,000, and who was told there was over $70,000 to make sure she was never elected again. A really **swell** gal, Gail. 

I'll find out who Zippy Dog is for sure and let you know soon enough.

Let's take a look at Griggs Fam: I've done some research and close to a dozen people have called Griggs a **real** asshole. {"Griggs Fam in the running with Larry Gibert for the biggest piece of Schlicht award in Mission Viejo."}  This joker **lives** to belittle or name call. He doesn't have a **valid intellectual** point, and the reason for that is **abundantly** obvious. If you read over his [comments on this thread](http://www.ocregister.com/news/park-345412-land-city.html) it's pretty clear he's completely cluelessness as to the example he's setting for his kids. And we both know that has been a point of contention in his marriage.

### Somewhere in one of his movies Clint Eastwood says "a man's got to know his limitations."

Heads up, Griggs, women get testy when you have kids and still act like an **8th grade asshole**.  That's why I never had kids. I know my limitations.  See my kids won't read this 'cause I don't have any, and while my wife will probably not like my name calling, she'll not be as pissed as if we had kids to think about.  Your kids, Griggs, on the other hand, will read this. Their friends will email the link asking "Hey is this **your** dad he's writing about?" 

Hey Griggs' kids, it gets better, you know?

Old Griggs used the same, lame parable against both my wife and I, which tells me he has a **micro-imagination**.  Get Mrs. Griggs drunk and I'm betting we can find out what else is small about Griggs' home. 

Here's the point I raised in the comments:

{% blockquote Daniel Avery http://www.ocregister.com/news/park-345412-land-city.html%}
Griggs Fam Explain where a dog park is fiscally irresponsible since there are $8 million earmarked for parks and the city has 53% of it's budget in reserves and a AAA bond rating. I just don't see the irresponsible part. You all love to say "it's irresponsible,' but you can never seem to address why.
{% endblockquote %}

Here's his analysis:

Daniel Avery Let me break it down to a level a 5 year old could get it for ya.

Little Danny went to the toy store and saw a super mega robot for $50 bucks, and because he knew his mommy had $50 he decided he wanted the "super mega robot." But his mommy knew she had to spend some of that $50 on getting other toys and fixing broken toys, so she told little Danny that he could get the "mega robot" for $25 and not the "super mega robot" for $50. Little Danny didn't like that, so he called his mommy a "hag" and a "negative idiot."

Seeing that good enough wasn't good enough for Danny, his mommy decided that she would not buy him the robot after all, until he learned to appreciate what he has, and to respect those that provide for him. 

Little Danny flopped on the floor and screamed - "BUT YOU SAID YOU HAD $50 TO SPEND AT THE TOY STORE."
{% endblockquote %}

Clever, huh? Let's not forget that the dog park is for all the people in Misison Viejo, those who pay taxes, homeowner taxes, and those who don't pay any taxes.  And let's not forget that Mission Viejo has more dogs per household than any other city in Orange County.  You all do the polticis and get back to me okay?

Meanwhile notice how Griggs fam doesn't even come close to addressing the issues of **why** it's irresponsible to build a dog park in a city that has 53% of the budget in reserves and $8 million for parks and recreation only.  The $8 million is not for slopes, it's not to take out trees here and there, it's not to fix streets and sidewalks. It other words, the city isn't able to use it on the things Morton says we need.  Griggs Fam, Morton's puppet, doesn't get it. There are no other "toys," and the only "broken toy" is the puppet Griggs Fam.

Griggs Fam: a man who **clearly** doesn't know his limitations. He doesn't seem to know his legs and arms are wired with strings which Brad Morton pulls to make him dance around like a clown in green pants while his wife and kids stare at him in horror.

You see, I am not brave.  I can just be a **much** bigger and **much more** colorful asshole if they insist on getting personal.  Be good to remember that.
