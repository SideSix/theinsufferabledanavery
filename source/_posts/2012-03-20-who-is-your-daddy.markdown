Larry Gilbert is now writing for Brad Morton in an attempt to distance himself from the stench of his association with the **North American Man Boy Love Association**. It's a political move because he is "managing" Cathy Schlicht's re-election campaign.

And why not manage Schlicht's campaign? He's been telling her what to say all along and{% img right /images/cathyhat.jpg 213 300 'Yep, Cathy Schlicht wore a tinfoil hat to a council meeting' 'Cathy Schlicht wearing a tin foil hat for real' %} when to shake, roll over, and beg.  Take a look at the photos of Gilbert and Schlicht up top.  Now imagine him making Schlicht beg.  Makes the flesh crawl doesn't it?

### Larry Gilbert's Lap Dogs

Larry's most recent piece of writing appeared this morning on Morton's rag.  In it he once again mentions that he owns a lap dog, as if that's proof he **actually** likes dogs. Many people own dogs and intentionally beat them; the get a twisted thrill out of abusing them. Owning a dog only proves one thing: that you own a dog. But Larry Gilbert is, clearly, as idiot and that much is proven every time Rhonda Reardon or Cathy Schlicht open their mouths to speak. 

Both Reardon and Schlicht have been doing Larry's bidding on the council and they actually have no ideas of their own. Well, to be fair, Cathy Schlicht did propose Larry's idea of putting a roundabout on the corner of Oso and Marguerite, which would have demolished a church on one corner and businesses on two other corners. The city spent $50,000 of our money to determine that was in **insanely stupid** idea.

Larry Gilbert was actually invited to write a blog for the Mission Viejo Patch, which is owned by AOL and has the largest readership base in Mission Viejo. He was invited to write a blog several times. He didn't take up the Patch's offer because he can't lie, distort, and deceive on the Patch.  You see, the Patch's editor is a good guy and AOL has a lot of excellent and highly paid lawyers. That combination would get in Larry's way.

Brad Morton, on the other hand, is a shitty lawyer who actually encourages lies, distortions, and deception on his blog.  All of this is good to remember **every single  time** either Reardon or Schlicht open their mouths.
