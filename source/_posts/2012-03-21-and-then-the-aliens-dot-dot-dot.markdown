### I'm not Schlichting you...

It'd be funny if it wasn't just so damn sad.  In her three years on the Mission Viejo City Council Cathy Schlicht has not done anything that would dispel the notion that she is clinically bat-schlicht-crazy.  In fact, her frequent outburst, disconnects with reality, and her spit-spewing, viscous attacks on city staff and the voters have convinced all who have watched one of her "performances" that she is the premiere rubber-room candidate for re-election.  Cathy Schlicht makes the Republican candidates for President look downright sane, and intelligent.

Take for instance her plan to put a roundabout on the corner of Oso and Marguerite in Mission Viejo.  It is the one agenda item that **looks** positive. At least if you're cruising through the intersection at 50 miles per hour.  If, however, you're stopped at a red light and consider her idea you'll immediately see that it would entail destroying businesses on two corners and a Presbyterian church on another. One less gas station and part of an office complex are no great loss. And I don't believe in a "Christian" God, but why take a **needless** risk by bulldozing a church.  {"All of this is obvious if you're stopped at a red light, but Schlicht demanded the city research the idea to the tune of $50,000."}  Now I'm as liberal as the next Kennedy, but, good people, that is an obscene waste of money.

The city of Mission Viejo has 53% of its operating budget in reserves and a AAA bond rating.  Schlicht works for a financial concern in Laguna Hills, California. Anyone employed in any aspect of the financial industry who states repeatedly, as Cathy Schlicht has, that the city's spending is "irresponsible" and "out of control" is either crazy or lying.  Either one is **not** a quality you'd want in a financial advisor or a city council member.
