I turned 13 on a Friday of the 13th of October. I don't think about it much.  It's just something that happened a lot of years ago.  I do remember being in a car in Northern Minnesota with my Mom and her Mom, plus my younger brother and sister.  Whenever we found ourselves in a car in Minnesota under those circumstances my Grandma was driving.  

Actually, my Grandma didn't "drive," she **rocketed** down country roads in her Dodge at what was then called a "breakneck speed."  I always understood that saying as being literal &ndash; like if something bad happened someone would end up with a broken neck. Quite often when Grandma was driving the trees went past so quickly they were a brown blur. So one of those times we were out driving around Nothern Minnesota, my mom noticed some cows lying down in a field.  "Must be gonna rain," my mom said, "The cows are lying down."

"Superstition is evil." That was all my Grandma said, but I took it to heart and when I turned 13 on a Friday, well, I didn't pay it no mind. When I met my best friend, Lazlo, he was living at 1313 East 6th Street over in Dinkytown, near the University of Minnesota.  I was living in this place on 8th Street, and my clocks never worked right.  There was the time in the world, and then there was 8th Street time. I listened to Tom Waits a lot, and Lazlo introduced me to The Persuasion. We walked down streets where snow was turning to slush singing "They often call me Speedo, but my real name is Mr. Earl."

Every Friday we would go down to Bootlegger's Sam's on Positively 4th Street and have a martini or three, before going to back to 1313, rounding up the women and taking them down to the Union Bar to dance all night to people like Muddy Waters. It wasn't hard back then to do live that way in Minneapolis.  I mean going down to a bar and dancing to someone like Muddy Waters all night long. You didn't even need a spiritual connection to Friday the 13th.

### My Grandma used to kill a mosquito and say "sinner!"

It's funny but I am not a superstitious man.  Nor am I stupid.  Today, a Friday the 13th, I went down to Bev-Mo because we were out of gin.  It's a liquor store of sorts, Bev-Mo. Victoria and I always have a martini on Friday nights.  Sort of like how Lazlo and I would wander down to that basement bar and have a martini; only my wife and I never end up dancing the night away to Muddy Waters in some dive bar. These are different times. And, you ask me, these times are a lot more scary.

Anyfuckingway, today, a Friday the 13th, I was in Bevmo and I probably would have been there even if none of the above happened. So I am walking down one of those booze-lined aisles and I stop. Good people, I mean to say that I **stopped**.

There on the shelf were two bottles.  One said "The Reverend" and the other "Salvation." Both of them were filled with Belgium-style Ale made by the Avery Brewing Company of Bolder Colorado. 

"The Reverend" and "Salvation."  I may not be superstitious, but I am **not** crazy either. I need all the "Salvation" I can get my hands around.
