When you listen to Cathy Schlicht and Rhonda Reardon talk, it sounds like most of the city is strongly opposed to the dog park being anywhere in Mission Viejo, except for some mythical, already existing park that the city will gladly turn over to be simply fenced. A cost Francis Holtzman says he'll shoulder.  

I've spent the last week waiting for these legions of people to speak out.  I mean besides the dozen or so that comment constantly on Brad Morton's blog that 

  * a. the city is broke, 
  * b. we aren't opposed to (plug in your project), and 
  * c. No one wants (plug in your project.) 
  
  <!-- more -->
  
 So where the devil are these folks?  Reardon swears the vast, overwhelming number of people in town don't want the dog park.  Cathy has been flinging that Schlicht for a few years now. I'm sorry, but are they imaginary friends of Reardon and Cathy?  You know like Mr. Nesbitt over there in the corner; he's the gentleman in the tweed cap and gray wool scarf.  I wouldn't want you to mistake him for Mr. Rizzo who is the one in the Derby. 
 
 On the O.C.Register there was the Griggs Family of, presumably, Mission Viejo. Someone in that family posted one ad hominem argument after another. While engaging in name-calling **is** fun, and it does relieve stress to some degree, it never really furthers an argument because you really don't have a point. I, myself, name-call from time to time.  I don't however have children who look up to me as a role model. Perhaps Mr. Griggs doesn't either.  Maybe he and I are the same, except that I also offer valid points which I back up with evidence.  Griggs seems to be one  of these "my beliefs out weight your facts" guys.
 
 At least Griggs put his own name out there and I can respect that. Over on the Mission Viejo Patch we have "Zippy Dog" and "MV Dadster" both of whom employed ad hominem arguments to some degree.  That is they attacked people, leveled charges, tried to employ shame as an argumentative strategy, and then didn't back up anything with specific data or details. This is the basic operating mode of the Gang of Five.*

 And, anyone who hides behind an alias in a community discussion...well, we just don't have to trust a word they say because they are hiding something. {"Good Lord, even Art Pedroza has moved away from allowing people to remain anonymous on his new blog."}

So that's **a whopping three people** Schlicht and Reardon are being guided by? At least on a representational level it is. We're talking roughly a ten to one margin; they are being guided by the one percent in true Republican fashion. I tossed out the Mission Viejo Dispatch because Brad Morton has censored every single positive comment that has been made on this issue.  People from two different groups in town have gone over to Morton's blog and left a positive comment at varying times during the last few days. This sort of censorship is how Morton operates on a routine basis. 
 
It might be a good idea to boycott the businesses who advertise on Morton's site.  They are helping to support censorship.  
 
 
*The Gang of Five are: Brad Morton, Larry Gilbert, Dale Tyler, Cathy Schlicht, and Francis Holtzman. I wish I could take credit for name this gaggle of goons, but it was done on the county level. Yep they are famous as being piles of Schlicht on the county level.
