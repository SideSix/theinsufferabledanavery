Dr. Hunter S. Thompson once said that "When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro." I doubt very much the good Doctor had ever met the likes of Cathy Schlicht. Oh, sure, Thompson entered the cesspool back when Richard Nixon owned it; back when Tricky Dick bathed it in daily, and then told Ed Meese to skim the fucker. Back in the good days when Republicans were Republicans and Democrats weren't Republicans. Back before Nixon looked and sounded like a Goddamn Liberal.

Thompson ate acid, and **then** drove to Vegas with an ether-soaked towel at his feet, smoking hash and snorting coke while bats and *other* nightmares swarmed down upon him. And he never, **ever**, lost his cool. He lived in a more **innocent** time of course, and he never met Cathy Schlicht or her **new** boy-toy: Orange County District Attorney Tony Ruckacacus.

### These Folks Will Protect Your Kids?

Take a good look at this man:

{% img left /images/tonyr.jpg 300 241 'The Only Politician To Endorse Cathy Schlicht' 'An image of District Attorney Ruckacacus.' %} That's Orange County District Attorney Tony Ruckacacus. The only politician who has endorsed Cathy Schlicht. Mainly because he **owes** her. You see, Cathy didn't even blink when he suggested we ban all sex offenders from public parks.  Let's ignore the fact that a "sex offender" might be someone who urinated in public; at night, hidden in hedges, and I bet you've done that and worse right? Let's ignore the fact that the **really** sick fucks, the ones who bugger kids just for kicks, look exactly like Uncle Tony and Aunt Cathy and show up at the park **with** the kids they plan on raping. And they do that each and **every** time. 

Does old Tony look like a man you could trust? I'll tell you what I see: old Tony is **on** something; he's on something **pretty** heavy. I'm talking grade A Pharm. Demerol at the very least. Trust me. You're looking at a man who has no idea where he is...I've been there, plenty of times, and it's fun...for about the first five minutes...right up until you realize that your brilliant political career went up in the flames fanned by Schlicht's notion of the modern version of Dachau. And then Larry Gilbert snaps a photo...

### The Bottom Line

Kids, it's simple. Take a good, hard, **long** look at **that** photo. Tony thinks Cathy Schlicht is good for Mission Viejo and **your** kids. I don't have kids. I'm **way** too selfish for "the kids thing," but, and here's the deal: that man scares the snot out of me. He's a stone cold junkie who is mainlining **something**. That much I **know.** There is **no way** I'd vote for anything or anyone he endorsed. Straight up.
