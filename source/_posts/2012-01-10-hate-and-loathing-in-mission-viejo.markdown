[Today it became known](http://missionviejo.patch.com/articles/committee-warned-for-election-violations-in-maclean-recall) that the Recall Lance MacLean Committee broke campaign laws under the direction of Dale Tyler and Connie Lee.  What this means for the taxpayers of Mission Viejo is that a group of malcontents cheated, lied, and broke laws to recall a council member by a mere 19 votes.  Clearly these people do not believe you have the right to a fair election among other things.  And one of these people, Cathy Schlicht, is running for reelection. That doesn't bode well for fairness next November.

If you look [at the people](http://theinsufferabledanavery.com/MacLeanRecall_Notice_of_Intention.pdf) who signed the notice of intention to recall petition, who you will see is the members of the Saddleback Republican Assembly. You will also see almost the entire readership of the Mission Viejo Dispatch, which has become a "hate blog."

Since Brad Morton, the editor of the Mission Viejo Dispatch claims he is just providing a news service I dropped by the Dispatch to see what news he was reporting. Nothing much.  Just the usual complaints about signs around town, street repair, and the usual "woe is me poor people might move here," which is code for black people. And there was the obligatory photo of Larry Gilbert.  Mr. Gilbert is that upright individual who [defended Art Pedroza](http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/12/blogger-v-blogger-socal-cybers.php) setting up links to the North American Man Boy Love Association and letting everyone believe the links went to Madison Alexander Public Relations. 

Just so you know, the North American Man Boy Love Association advocates, actually it encourages, grown men to take young boys, eight-years-old, and fuck them in the ass. I totally can see why Larry Gilbert would defend **that**.

And there was a very long article full of comments because the Mission Viejo Mayor declared December 16th Muslim Heritage Day. That prompted the hate to spew like vomit at a Frat Party. The article ends with a curious sentence:

 > The Orange County Islamic Foundation and Mission Viejo Masjid (Mosque) are located on Madero near Alicia Park.
 
You have to wonder why Brad Morton wrote that one. Just so one of his crazy friends would know where to set up with a sniper rifle? I wouldn't put it past anyone in that group. 

And amid all this hate there wasn't one word, not one, about Dale Tyler or Connie Lee breaking the law. Perverting a recall is certainly a lot bigger news story than some streets with cracks in them.
