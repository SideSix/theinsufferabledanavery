  <h1>About Dan</h1>
  <p>I received a B.A. from Macalester College, in Saint Paul, Minnesota and a M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from The University of California, Irvine.  I'm a poet who hand-crafts web sites. Here's what I'm most proud of: when my future mother-in-law asked Norm to tell her something about me he said, "I've known Dan for over twenty years and he's never once lied to me." </p>
